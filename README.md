# Synistralia.com website

Synistralia.com is the website for Synistralia Software, LLC.

The site is a very simple NodeJS/ExpressJS website using Bootstrap for the UI. The site is hosted in a Docker container on Google Container Engine. (Normally this would be massive overkill for such a simple site, but we already have a cluster in place there, so it made hosting easier to do it this way.) The Kubernetes configuration files are available in the companion repository, https://github.com/mrwatson/synistralia-deployments.
